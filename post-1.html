      <p class="blog_text">I’ve decided to (re)start a blog.</p>
      <p class="blog_text">
        My main motivation comes from the project I’m working on. I’ve been
        creating an inventory management system for the MRU Chemistry
        department. To my surprise, writing php hasn’t been the worst part –
        <em>it’s been the emails.</em> I’ve always hated writing, probably
        because I have never felt good at it. I’m often tempted to just throw
        something like the following into chatGPT:
      </p>

      <p class="blog_text quote">
        <em
          >“Feature 1 2 and 3 complete ask for
          <span class="spelling_mistake">clarificaiton</span>
          on feature 4 need to know about more about hazard classes write update
          email please”
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="blog_text">
        I’m not going to lie and say I’ve never used chatGPT to write an email–
        the issue is that I might be using it too much. I’ve noticed that I have
        been less sure of what I want and need to communicate. This makes
        auditing the output of chatGPT a longer process than it should be. I
        think my productivity would be improved if I didn’t have to go back and
        forth with a chatbot to write an email that I (probably) should be able
        to write in 1 - 2 minutes. Long story short: I’ve realized that I need
        to improve my technical and non-technical writing skills, and this blog
        will be my place to practice.
